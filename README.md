Breast Cancer is one of the leading cancer developed in many countries including India. Though the endurance rate is high â€“ with early diagnosis 97% women can survive for more than 5 years. Statistically, the death toll due to this disease has increased drastically in last few decades. The main issue pertaining to its cure is early recognition. Hence, apart from medicinal solutions some Data Science solution needs to be integrated for resolving the death causing issue. This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection and hyper parameter selection. The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this i have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input.




In this project in python, we learned to build a breast cancer tumour predictor on the wisconsin dataset and created graphs and results for the same. It has been observed that a good dataset provides better accuracy. Selection of appropriate algorithms with good home dataset will lead to the development of prediction systems. These systems can assist in proper treatment methods for a patient diagnosed with breast cancer. There are many treatments for a patient based on breast cancer stage; data mining and machine learning can be a very good help in deciding the line of treatment to be followed by extracting knowledge from such suitable databases
